## What I Learned
During the development of this game, I learned several important concepts and techniques:

- Gravity and velocity: I implemented a gravity effect on the game objects, allowing them to fall and move with realistic physics.
- Using the DOM to create objects: I utilized the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically create and manipulate game objects within the web page.
- Destructuring in JavaScript: I made use of destructuring syntax to extract values from objects and arrays, simplifying my code and improving readability.
- Boolean value checking: Before performing certain actions or tests, I checked boolean values to ensure that the conditions were met.
- Rectangular collision detection: I implemented a collision detection algorithm based on rectangular bounding boxes, allowing for accurate detection of collisions between game objects.
- Restarting the canvas with the init function: I created an init function that resets the game canvas, allowing for a fresh start after completing a level or restarting the game.

These concepts and techniques were crucial in the development of this 2D Mario game, and I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in game development.
