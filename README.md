# Mario Game

This project is a game that utilizes gravity and velocity to create a fun gaming experience. It is built using JavaScript and the DOM to create objects and implement game mechanics. You must run the program on your server.

## Features

- Gravity + Velocity: The game incorporates realistic physics by simulating gravity and velocity for the game objects.
- DOM Manipulation: The game utilizes the Document Object Model (DOM) to create and manipulate objects on the screen.
- Destructuring: JavaScript's destructuring feature is used to efficiently extract values from objects and arrays.
- Boolean Value Checking: The game checks boolean values before performing certain actions, ensuring efficient and error-free execution.
- Rectangular Collision Detection: The game implements collision detection logic to detect collisions between objects in a rectangular shape.
- Canvas Restart: The game provides a function called `init` that allows for easy restart of the canvas, resetting the game state.
- Constructor Usage: The game utilizes constructors to build classes and allow objects to take in parameters later.
- Webpack: The project uses Webpack, a popular module bundler, to manage dependencies and optimize the game's performance.

## Getting Started

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/mario-game.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

5. Demo at [Demo](https://mario-2d.vercel.app)

## Improvements

Some future implementation I plan on doing, is adding music to the game, also adding artwork to the game! I would like to create a customized character that's built with sprite so you can have a real feeling.
